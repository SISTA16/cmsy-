Data was taken from Table 6: Summary of reference points over the 54 models with the 8 region model in the structural uncertainty grid. Mean values reported herein. F/Fmsy value consists of the Frecent/FMSY (i.e., Average fishing mortality-at-age for a recent period, 2014?2017, relative to FMSY). The BMSY column consists of SBmsy. The WCPFC adopted 20%SBF=0 as a limit reference point (LRP) for the skipjack stock where SBF=0 for this assessment is calculated as the average over the period 2008?2017. The recently adopted target reference point (TRP) for this stock is 50%SBF=0 where SBF=0 is again calculated over 2008?2017. Stock status was referenced against these points by calculating the reference points; SBrecent/SBF=0 and SBlatest/SBF=0 where SBF=0 is calculated over 2008?2017 and SBlatest and SBrecent are the estimated spawning potential in 2018, and the mean over 2015?2018, respectively. The other key reference point, Frecent/FMSY, is the estimated average fishing mortality at the full assessment area scale over a recent period of time (Frecent; 2014?2017 for this stock assessment) divided by the fishing mortality producing MSY which is a product of the yield analysis.
